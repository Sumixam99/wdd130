                    <h2>President Nelson</h4>
                
                    <p>In this project, I created a card with information about President Nelson. In this project, I learned about centering a div, using flex-box to format elements, and using border-radius to make an element look nicer. I also learned about using line breaks in the p element.</p>

                    <h2>Favorite Devotionals</h4>
                
                    <p>In this project, I created a table containing information for a Devotional that I enjoy. I also created a form that can take inputs for all the information needed to add a new Devotional, but there is no backend to make it work. While working on this project I learned about tables and forms.</p>

                    <h2>Valentines Day</h2>
                
                    <p>In this project, I took preexisting HTML and used CSS to stlye it however I wanted in order to make the best Valentines Day website that I could. I learned about how important CSS is when making a website usable and how vast a difference CSS can make.</p>

                    <h2>Positioning</h2>
                
                    <p>Positioning was a project about using Grid to position colored blocks in a div. I learned ways to use grid, how to use z-index to control how elements are layered, that grid is not a good way to get text to wrap around an element, and that their is a better way to do that.</p>

                    <h2>Flags</h2>
                
                    <p>In this project, I used Grid to create a selection of different national flags. I learned about using gap to create space between to parts of a Grid and I also got lots more practice using grid to position and overlap elements.</p>

                    <p>In this project, I edited photos of Jesus Christ to bring them to a more proper quality for a website. I learned the standard PPI of a image on a website and I learned how to use Photopea to edit the PPI and the dimensions of an image.</p>

                    <h2>Signup</h2>
                
                    <p>In this project I formated the frontend of a popup that asked the user for their information to send them gosple messages. I learned to use grid in order to overlap things in complex ways and I learned about how to prevent anything from overflowing onto the border of an element.</p>
