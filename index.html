                I'm a Computer Science major who enjoys solving challenging problems. I'm not the biggest fan of CSS, but using block formating has made it much better, but HTML is still boring. I prefer working with the back-end and have learned Python and C++. What I like about Python is that it is a programming language that acutally likes it's user. When I make websites, I enjoy making intentionally poor aesthetic to make it more silly. The big tool that helps me make the poor aesthetic images is Microsoft Paint, which I love because of how flexible it is, but hate because of how tedious using it can be.

                Hobbies of mine are playing board games and playing video games, I also enjoy watching movies with my friends and family. I also enjoy sepending time in nature, especilly camping and hunting. I love spending time with my family. My favorite board game is Eclipse, second dawn for the galaxy (though I've never randomly met someone who knows about eclipse), however, if I had to choose a game that I own then my favorite is Oath. My favorite video game is Hollow Knight (I think it has better exploration that it's sequal Silksong), but it is closely followed by Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon. My favorite part about camping is that I get to spend time with my family enjoying the beauty of nature and what makes hunting esspecily fun is that I get to ride side by sides through the mountain all day.

                Something that I don't like is spelling, I'm not very good at it and it doesn't have the same logical syntax the code does. The problem is made even worse because unlike Microsoft Word, VS Code doesn't have a spell checker to correct all of my mistakes.
